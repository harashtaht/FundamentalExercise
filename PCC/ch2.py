'''
we added a variable named message, and the string is the value.
few variables rules:
- v. names can only contain letters, numbers and underscores. 
    can not start with a number.
- spaces are not allowed
- avoid using Python keywords and function names as v.names.
- should be short but descriptive
- be careful when using the lowercase letter l and uppercase letter O, 
    they could be confused w/ numbers 1 and 0
