# -- Chapter 7 : User Input and While Loops -- #

'''
The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text.
Once Python receives the user's input,
it stores it in a variable to make it convenient for you to work with.
The input() function takes one argument: the prompt, or instructions,
that we want to display to the user so they know what to do.
'''

prompt = "If you tell us who you are, we can personalize the messages you see."
prompt += "\nWhat is your first name? "

# name = input(prompt)
# print("\nHello, " + name + "!")

'''
When you use the input() function, Python interprets everything the user enters as a string.
'''

# height = input("How tall are you, in inches? ")
# height = int(height)

# if height >= 36:
#     print("\nYou're tall enough to ride!")
# else:
#     print("\nYou'll be able to ride when you're a little older.")
